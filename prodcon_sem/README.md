### User
  For the semaphore file, I used some of my code from part 1.1 as a base. 
  
  Unlike part 1.1, I had to integrate 3 unique functions called Enqueue, Dequeue, and print_buffer. These functions are more unique in a way that they includes semaphores within or print values of the semaphores. 
  
  My approach was to get the base functionality to work (copy code of part 1.1) first. Once that's done and tested out - I started to include semaphore statements. 
  
  

### Kernel

  I used project part 3 and 4 as a rough reference as to how to set up the kernel for the semaphore files. I made sure to add the functions in all of my kernel files to properly execute them.
